# Module 3: How can you be a good data steward?

## Data Ethics

### Categories

- **Purpose Limitation & Informed Consent** - Donor, client and volunteer data are usually given for a specific mission purpose; re-use without fresh consent breaches trust and often national privacy law.
- **Privacy, Security & Confidentiality** - Datasets may expose health, migration-status or abuse history; a breach can endanger lives and violate regulations (HIPAA, GDPR, COPPA, etc.).
- **Ownership & Data Sovereignty** - Individuals (and in some cases communities) have rights to control how their data is used
- **Fairness, Equity & Bias Mitigation** - Algorithmic or reporting bias can reinforce structural inequities in service-delivery or fundraising decisions.
- **Transparency & Accountability** - Funders and the public expect to know what data a nonprofit holds, how algorithms shape decisions, and who is responsible for errors or abuse.
- **Data Quality & Integrity** - Poor or biased data can misdirect limited charitable resources and erode donor confidence; ethics demands truthfulness and rigor.
- **Harm Minimization** - Even lawful data uses can create unintended harm (doxing, stigma, predictive policing). Ethical review asks: Could this hurt the population we serve?
- **Openness vs. Protection** - Nonprofits juggle calls for open data (transparency, collaboration) with duties to safeguard sensitive information.

### Activity

Which are most pressing? Why?

## Data Governance

### Key Questions to Consider

1. How does data flow through our organization?
2. How is our data collected and stored?
3. How do we ensure that our data is high quality?
4. Who has access to our data?
5. What security protocols are in place to protect our data?
6. How are we considering policies and regulations that impact our data?
7. How are we empowering and educating our employees and volunteers?

### Activity

Consider the [education scenario](module_01.html#education). Reflect upon how you would address the key data governance questions as it relates to their needs. Address each of the questions as best as you can.
