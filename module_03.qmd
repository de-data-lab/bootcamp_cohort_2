# Module 3: How can you be a good data steward?

## Data Ethics

### Categories

- **Purpose Limitation & Informed Consent** - Donor, client and volunteer data are usually given for a specific mission purpose; re-use without fresh consent breaches trust and often national privacy law.
- **Privacy, Security & Confidentiality** - Datasets may expose health, migration-status or abuse history; a breach can endanger lives and violate regulations (HIPAA, GDPR, COPPA, etc.).
- **Ownership & Data Sovereignty** - Individuals (and in some cases communities) have rights to control how their data is used
- **Fairness, Equity & Bias Mitigation** - Algorithmic or reporting bias can reinforce structural inequities in service-delivery or fundraising decisions.
- **Transparency & Accountability** - Funders and the public expect to know what data a nonprofit holds, how algorithms shape decisions, and who is responsible for errors or abuse.
- **Data Quality & Integrity** - Poor or biased data can misdirect limited charitable resources and erode donor confidence; ethics demands truthfulness and rigor.
- **Harm Minimization** - Even lawful data uses can create unintended harm (doxing, stigma, predictive policing). Ethical review asks: Could this hurt the population we serve?
- **Openness vs. Protection** - Nonprofits juggle calls for open data (transparency, collaboration) with duties to safeguard sensitive information.
