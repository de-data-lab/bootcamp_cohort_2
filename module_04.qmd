![Voice Prioritization](voice_prioritization.png)

### Activity

Who matters most for your story?​

You are a leader at a nonprofit organization focused on providing educational resources to underprivileged children. You are reviewing data for two upcoming meetings.​

The meetings include:​

A first meeting with a high-influence funder​

A second with a high-interest community group​

How would your data story shift when speaking to a *high-influence* funder vs. a *high-interest* community group?
