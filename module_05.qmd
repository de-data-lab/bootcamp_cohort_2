# Module 5: How do you build a data driven organization?

### Activity

We will begin to develop your wish list towards the beginnings of developing your data strategy.

In your respective teams, you will be doing the following:

1. First, add every single goal you would like to accomplish as a data-driven organization ​
2. Once all your goals are listed, rank them from least to most feasible (score of 1) ​
3. Once ranked for feasibility, next rank them from least to most impactful (score of 1) ​
4. Next add the scores for feasibility and impact (you might end up with ties!) ​
5. Meet back in main room! Be ready to share your top 3 overall priorities.
